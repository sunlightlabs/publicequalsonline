				<p>There are several ways you can help this campaign. The first and most important thing you can do is to sign and share the pledge to demonstrate your support.</p>

				                                                               SIGN              SHARE

				<p>It is through the pledge that this campaign will build political clout strong enough to move government. We need those muscles to be as big as possible.</p>

				<p>Throughout this campaign, we will make Calls to Congress, send Letters to the Editor, organize Days of Action around such legislation as the Public Online Information Act (H.R. 4858 (http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4858/show)) or the Read the Bill legislation (H.Res 554 (http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr554/show)).

				Similarly, we will make sure candidates for office across the country are held to account for how transparent they will be if elected. We'll ask them questions at town halls, write blog posts diving into campaign data, fundraiser parties or cover events on video and post them to the web.

				There are a thousand things we can do together - many of which we don't even know yet - but first we must come together, and for the next few weeks, that is what we will focus on. concerned about having time-sensitive copy here. Jake, it's your responsibility to make sure it doesn't say 'few weeks' indefinitely -Gabriela Schneider 3/17/10 4:28 PM 

				The second most important thing you can do right now is to educate yourself and others about what is happening in your city, state and congressional district. We don't know everything we need to know, and that's where you can help.

				                                    EDUCATE (link to "educate" page)

				Finally, this campaign needs those who will volunteer to lead and act in their communities. If you're willing to step up, just fill out this form and we'll be in touch!

				Actually making government more transparent is a monumental task, and it's going to take all of us to make it happen. For your support, the following can't be said enough: Thank you!
