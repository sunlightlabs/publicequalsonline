				<p>It is through the pledge that this campaign will build political clout strong enough to move government. We need those muscles to be as big as possible.
</p>
<p>
				Throughout this campaign, we will send Letters to the Editor and make Calls to Congress. We'll also organize Days of Action around such legislation as the Public Online Information Act (<a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4858/show">H.R. 4858</a>) or the Read the Bill legislation (<a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr554/show">H.Res. 554</a>). We'll ask candidates for office questions at town halls, write blog posts diving into campaign data or post video of important events.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a thousand things we can do together - many of which we don't even know yet - but first we must come together. For the first few weeks, that is our focus. It will also be a lot of fun!
			</p>
			<p>
				The second most important thing you can do right now is to educate yourself and others about what is happening in your city, state and congressional district. We don't know everything we need to know, and that's where you can help.
