	<p>
		We believe an open, transparent government is more deserving of our trust, and is one that allows its citizens the ability to fully participate, collaborate and hold government accountable as our Founders intended. We also believe that open government data has the potential to create new social enterprise and spur innovation like little else.</p>
		<p>

		To create the open government we seek, we know we need (at least) three things:
	</p>

<ul id="no_bull">
	<li>
	<p>
		1.) Transparency Laws requiring public government data to be published online and in real time - accessible to any citizen, at any time from any location.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		2.) Transparency tools harnessing the latest online and mobile technology, allowing citizens, journalists and bloggers to search, sort, mash and make use of government data.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		3.) A Transparency Movement of citizens advocating for online, real-time access to public government data, and engaging with government in new ways to hold government accountable.
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>	
	<p>
		To accomplish these goals, the Public=Online campaign will put pressure on government by connecting the hackers, bloggers, journalists and citizens across the country who are taking up the fight to make government truly open.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that putting enough pressure on government to pass the laws that make government transparency a reality will require massive political muscle, and by November 2010 we will build a voting bloc of citizens calling for open government that is so large it cannot be ignored.
	</p>
	<p>
		Join us today by <a href="/pledge/">signing and sharing</a> our pledge which lets government officials at every level know that we are serious about government transparency.
